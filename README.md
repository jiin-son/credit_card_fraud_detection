# credit_card_fraud_detection

### In this project, I'm building a fraud model using data from Kaggle. I'm currently reviewing fraud models at my job and I wanted to build one by my own. My goal is to update github everyday with my progress. I hope this project will lead me to further growth in my career. 

### the data was retrived from: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
